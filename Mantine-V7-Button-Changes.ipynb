    "\n",
    "### Old syntax (v6 and earlier):\n",
    "```tsx\n",
    "<Button leftIcon={<IconSearch size={16} />} rightIcon={<IconArrowRight size={16} />}>\n",
    "  Button with icons\n",
    "</Button>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### New syntax (v7+):\n",
    "```tsx\n",
    "<Button leftSection={<IconSearch size={16} />} rightSection={<IconArrowRight size={16} />}>\n",
    "  Button with icons\n",
    "</Button>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Changed?\n",
    "- `leftIcon` is now `leftSection`\n",
    "- `rightIcon` is now `rightSection`\n",
    "- Both sections can now contain any React elements, not just icons\n",

    "\n",
    "The `fallbackSrc` prop provides a more streamlined way to handle missing images and loading states.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How This Helps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Better Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing images without showing broken image placeholders\n",
    "2. **Improved User Experience**: Shows a meaningful fallback instead of an error\n",
    "3. **Type Safety**: The component is properly typed to accept all these parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is being used throughout the RAGIJI Foundation website to ensure a consistent user experience even when images fail to load."
